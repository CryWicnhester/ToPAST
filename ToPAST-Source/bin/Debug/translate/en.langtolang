MSSQL 2008 has it's limits, so I suggest you don't use it.{}{}Second, install the server. Make sure you enable  Non-Windows authenticated users.{}{}Note: {}      MSSQL 2005-2008 enforces the "Instance" system, in which you just add the "IP\INSTANCE_NAME" in your server calls.[]The GMServer is relatively easy to setup.{}{}Here is the basic line-by-line description:{}{}port=194    You must not change this.{}SQLHost:    Location of your SQL Server{}SQLUser:    User for your SQL Server (For security reasons, I suggest you change this up...{}SQLPass:    Password for SQL Server... if you're using same user as gameserver, then the password is "Y87dc#$98"{}SQLAccDB=AccountServer{}SQLGameDB=GameDB[]The GM Server is used as if it was a proxy to communicate to the ToPAST client, and get info quickly.{}{}There are certain permissions that show how you are permitted to do something.{}{}A GA is allowed to do anything. A GM cannot see other GMs in the Account && Character managers.[]The Bounty Item Repricer is primarily used to reprice bounty Items... which are the primary items that drop from monsters. You can also use this to reprice other Item Types.{}{}You can set the Max && minimum prices, and set the multiplier, which controls how much they get per item. When you load && process a file, you may revert it with a backup if an error has occur*.{}{}This tool can only be used for items.[]The Experience-Per-Level Calculator is used to get the experience based on rarely-used Calculations.

When you click one, it will send you to the character manager with the selected character.[]The Character finder allows you to find a character by any phrase in the character name. Leaving the line blank will let you see ALL of the characters at once. This may be slow.{}{}Upon selecting the character, 4 more tabs will show up, and the character attribute editor will show up.[]In this tab, you may change the character name, Change the account, and change they character type.{}{}If you change the character type, make sure you change their equips Or else you may not be able to see their equips in-game, and an error may occor in-game.[]Welcome to the ToPAST Help dialog!{}{}Here, you can get help with:{}{}SQL Setup{}Server Setup{}Client Setup{}ToPAST Setup{}ToPAST GM Server Setup{}ToPAST Help{}{}To View cr*its on this tool, please goto: {}ToPAST->About->Cr*its{}{}All of the cr*its are viewable there.[]The Skill Viewer is used to View the current skills on the player, and change, delete, or add skills.{}{}The skills you probably don't wanna change, as they are the base skills are:{}Bare Hand{}Sword{}Greatsword{}Bow{}Firegun{}Dagger{}Gold Pouch{}Dual Weapon{}{}These skills have been given to you when you start the game, and editing them may harm your character.[]The Position Finder is used to easily change the current coordinates of a character.{}{}The r* blinking marker is used to show where you currently you are.{}{}The b* blinking marker is used to show where you could be upon saving.{}{}When you save it, the b* marker becomes r* to show that the character currently is.{}{}You can specify which map and custom coordinates the character may appear at.[]The inventoy viewer was the bulk of my total work.
